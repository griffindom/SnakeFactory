Griffin Dominguez:
I created 2 tests. The first (testEndScreen) verifies that the end screen appears after ten rooms. The second (testFirstRoom) test verifies that the
first room has four doors.

Sydney Hahn:

I created 2 test cases that verify the funtionality of door 2 and the return button if door 2 is an option and is clicked.

James Sherman:
I created 2 test cases: testDoor1Through() and testDoor1GoBackFunc() to test the
functionality of going through the first door all the way until the end screen is reached
as well as the return button functionality. Notice how after going back and then clicking the first door again,
the same room is displayed.
