Griffin Dominguez:
I created 2 tests. The first (testEndScreen) verifies that the end screen appears after ten rooms. The second (testFirstRoom) test verifies that the
first room has four doors.

Sydney Hahn:

I created 2 test cases that verify the funtionality of door 3 and the return button if door 3 is an option and is clicked. If door 3 isn't an option then door 1 is clicked.

William McLanahan:
I created 2 tests, the first is testGoBackTwiceFunc() to ensure that you were able to go back a door more than one time.
The second test (testLastRoomToFirst()) ensures that the player can fully traverse from the back of the maze to the front.

James Sherman:
I created 2 test cases: testDoor1Through() and testDoor1GoBackFunc() to test the
functionality of going through the first door all the way until the end screen is reached
as well as the return button functionality. Notice how after going back and then clicking the first door again,
the same room is displayed.


Jasper Pilkenton:
I created 2 test cases: The first testEndScreenMultipleDoors() verifies that the end screen appears after ten rooms have been accessed,

regardless of which doors (door 1, 2, 3, or 4) were chosen. The second testRoom1toEndScreen() verifies that the first room
has 4 doors, and that each of those doors could be the path to the endScreen (as long as the player moves through 10 distinct rooms)
