Griffin Dominguez:
I created 2 tests. The first (testEndScreen) verifies that the end screen appears after ten rooms. The second (testFirstRoom) test verifies that the
first room has four doors.

Sydney Hahn:

I created 2 test cases that verify the funtionality of door 2 and the return button if door 2 is an option and is clicked.

William McLanahan:

James Sherman:
I created 2 test cases: testDoor1Through() and testDoor1GoBackFunc() to test the
functionality of going through the first door all the way until the end screen is reached
as well as the return button functionality. Notice how after going back and then clicking the first door again,
the same room is displayed.


Jasper Pilkenton:
I created 2 test cases: The first testEndScreenMultipleDoors() verifies that the end screen appears after ten rooms have been accessed,
regardless of which doors (door 1, 2, 3, or 4) were chosen. The second testRoom1toEndScreen() verifies that the first room 
has 4 doors, and that each of those doors could be the path to the endScreen (as long as the player moves through 10 distinct rooms).
