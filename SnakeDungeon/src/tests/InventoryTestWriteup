Griffin Dominguez: I created 2 tests, testHealthPotion and testStartingWeapon. testHealthPotion tests to make sure that the
players health is restored after consuming a health potion. testStartingWeapon tests to make sure that the starting weapon shows
in the inventory.


Sydney Hahn: I created 2 tests, testAttackPotion and testItemAdded. testAttackPotion tests to ensure that the attack potion
increases a players damage dealt accordingly. testItemAdded tests to ensure that an item is dropped every time a snake is
defeated.


William McLanahan: I created 2 tests, testInventoryThere and testDroppedItemThere. The first test ensures the inventory
is present when in a room. The second test ensures that an item is always dropped after slaying a snake.


James Sherman: I created testArmor and testInventoryNotCarriedOver. The first test tests to see if armor works. The second
test tests to see if once a player dies the inventory is not carried over into the next game.
