Griffin Dominguez: I created 2 tests, testHealthPotion and testStartingWeapon. testHealthPotion tests to make sure that the
players health is restored after consuming a health potion. testStartingWeapon tests to make sure that the starting weapon shows
in the inventory.

William McLanahan: I created 2 tests, testInventoryThere and testDroppedItemThere. The first test ensures the inventory
is present when in a room. The second test ensures that an item is always dropped after slaying a snake.
