Griffin Dominguez: I created 2 tests, testHealthPotion and testStartingWeapon. testHealthPotion tests to make sure that the
players health is restored after consuming a health potion. testStartingWeapon tests to make sure that the starting weapon shows
in the inventory.


Sydney Hahn: I created 2 tests, testAttackPotion and testItemAdded. testAttackPotion tests to ensure that the attack potion
increases a players damage dealt accordingly. testItemAdded tests to ensure that an item is dropped every time a snake is
defeated.


William McLanahan: I created 2 tests, testInventoryThere and testDroppedItemThere. The first test ensures the inventory
is present when in a room. The second test ensures that an item is always dropped after slaying a snake.


James Sherman: I created testArmor and testInventoryNotCarriedOver. The first test tests to see if armor works. The second
test tests to see if once a player dies the inventory is not carried over into the next game. 


Jasper Pilkenton: I created useMultipleItems() and testItemsStays(). The first of which tests to see if the player can use/consume
more than 1 item at a time (E.g. equipping a new weapon and consuming a potion one after another). The second tests that an item will stay 
in the room after the player leaves (given the player has not picked the item up) and that the player can subsequently go-back to the room 
and pick up the item.
