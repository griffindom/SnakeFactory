Griffin Dominguez: The first test I wrote, testDeathPopUp(), checks to make sure a message stating you failed the game pops up correctly
upon death. The second test I wrote, testEndGame(), makes sure the game ends after the player clicks the quit button.

Sydney Hahn: I wrote 2 tests, testDeclineChallenge() and testMultChallengeRoom(). The first one tests what happens 
when you decline a challenge upon entering a challenge room. The second one tests that the player encounters at least 2
challenge rooms during the game.

William McLanahan: I wrote 2 tests, testBeatGame() ensured that the player can play the game from start to finish without
encountering any errors. The other test I wrote was testDeath() which verifies that when a player's health 
reaches 0 the player dies and is able to restart.  

James Sherman: I wrote testChallengeNoRetreat() and testChallengeMultEnemies(). The first test
tests to make sure you cannot retreat from a challenge room. The second test tests to see that multiple
enemies spawn in a challenge room. 

Jasper Pilkenton: I wrote testChallengeReward() and testRestartAfterGameOver(), the first of which checks to see if the player 
is awarded full health after beating the challenge room. The second test verifies that once a player beats the game they can 
choose to restart while still in game (AKA they do not have to re-launch the game to play again)
