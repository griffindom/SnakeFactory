Sydney Hahn: I wrote 2 tests, testDeclineChallenge() and testMultChallengeRoom(). The first one tests what happens 
when you decline a challenge upon entering a challenge room. The second one tests that the player encounters at least 2
challenge rooms during the game.

William McLanahan: I wrote 2 tests, one that ensured that there was a death screen when a snake defeats you in batlle. The other test I
did was making sure that the challenge room gave you a choice before you fight in it.

James Sherman: I wrote testChallengeNoRetreat() and testChallengeMultEnemies(). The first test
tests to make sure you cannot retreat from a challenge room. The second test tests to see that multiple
enemies spawn in a challenge room.
