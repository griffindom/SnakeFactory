Griffin Dominguez:
I created two tests. The first test verifies that a snake swans in every room. The second test verifies that upon dealth,
the player is taken back to the configuration screen.

Sydney Hahn:
I created 2 tests that test the damage of 2 of the weapons: the longsword and the dagger. It ensures that the weapon's damage
affects the player's health accordingly.

William McLanahan:
I created 2 tests regarding the player's health points. The first tests verifies that the player is able to take damage
when a snake attacks him/her. The second test verifies that the player's HP does not reset when entering a room again.

James Sherman:
I created two test to test the retreat mechanism. The first test verifies that the snake spawned in the first room
before and after retreat are the same. The second test tests if the snake in the first room is different than the snake
that spawns in a different room. 

Jasper Pilkenton:
I created 2 tests, the first of which tests to verify that our weapon damage calculation using a random function works as intended
(makes sure damage output is not outside of damage range). The second test verifies that the weapon damage calculation works
with the Mace-weapon's damage range (each weapon has a different damage range).
