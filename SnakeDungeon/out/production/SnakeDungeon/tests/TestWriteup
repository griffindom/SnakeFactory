Griffin Dominguez:
I created 2 tests. The first verifies the initial game screen shows correctly. The second test checks to see if the second screen displays after clicking on the "Start" button.
These tests are testWelcomeScreen() and testStart(), respectively.

Sydney Hahn:
I created 2 tests to verify that the user enters all the information needed to begin the game.
The emptyNameNotAllowed() test verifies that the user enters a non-empty name by first clicking on the start button, choosing a weapon, then clicking begin. If the begin button works, then the choose difficulty slider will be gone and the name entered should be valid.
The testBegin() test verifies that the begin button works. First, the start button is clicked, then a valid name is entered, a weapon is chosen, then the begin button is clicked. If the difficulty slider is gone, then the begin button works.


William McLanahan: Created a test to make sure that the Begin button would be present on the configuration screen
upon clicking the Start button. This ensures that the player will be able to continue to the game
once they are ready to do so. I also created a test that made sure the gold counter is correct after the first difficulty slider.

Jasper Pilkenton:
I created 2 tests. The first verifies that the longSwordButton is a functioning button - verifying that when clicking on the longSwordButton 
the Long Sword is selected as the starting weapon. The second test verifies that the preliminary game settings have been clicked/selected properly
so that the game can begin.
